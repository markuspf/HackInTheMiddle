# HackInTheMiddle -- calling SageMath from GAP using SCSCP hacks

the code in this repository provides a hack on top of some hacks with some hacks
to compute properties of Origamis.

This code is meant to be as a explorative prototype.

To use code in this library you need a working installation of SageMath and GAP,
both with SCSCP packages installed.

GAP comes with an SCSCP package (called SCSCP) and a WIP package
(MathInTheMiddle) that also implements the SCSCP protocol.
